# Cat Classification

## Goal
The goal of this project is to recognize if in the photo there is my black cat. In essence the project concerns about image classifcation one-vs-rest, where the positive class is the prensence of my black cat, and the negative is all the rest (other cat different the black, background, people, ...). </br>
I have done this system that recognizes if the black cat is in the picture because black cat has a food problem and it should eat only a specific type (more expensive) of food. </br>

## Section
The project initially is concerned with the creation of the recognition system, then when has recognized the black cat, it will give the food from the feeder.

## Data Collection
I have collected the photo through the ESP32CAM, the photo are 96x96 RGB888, so 24 of bit-depth.
